# Summary

I am a Master's graduate in Genetics and Molecular Biology and current PhD Candidate, specializing in the intersection of genomics, bioinformatics, and public health surveillance. My core technical skills include high-throughput sequencing data analysis (RNA-Seq processing, assembly, differential expression), advanced Python and R programming, and expert command-line proficiency (Linux). I have a proven ability to translate complex molecular and epidemiological data into actionable insights, demonstrated through the development of bioinformatics pipelines for pathogen sequence identification and the creation of real-time public health dashboards leveraging large-scale disease information systems. I am adept at collaborating across scientific disciplines to address pressing health challenges and committed to strengthening regional capacity in data-driven disease monitoring and outbreak response.
